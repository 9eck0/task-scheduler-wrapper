# task-scheduler-wrapper (WIP)
A lightweight wrapper over Java's native ExecutorService, extends its functionality with additionnal scheduling options and recurrence control.

# Origins
This module is extracted from an university project (IFT2255) where I had to integrate scheduling functionality to a backend for a mockup Gym membership system. Intending to keep the task scheduling service lightweight, but not satisfied with Java's native ExecutorService, I've opted to write a wrapper around it in order to manage individual tasks with ease and flexibility.
